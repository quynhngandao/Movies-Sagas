# Movies Sagas

## Description

_Duration: weekend challenge_

This is a full-stack app built with React and Redux-Saga which allows users to view a gallery of movie items. The data are stored in a postgreSQL database. The client-side will display the list of movies (image, title, and description). User can toggle to read the collapsible movie description. User can click on the image which directs the user to the specific movie with details of that movie (title, genres,and description). User can also go back to home page by clicking on either buttons (home icon or "go home").
## Installation

2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. Please use [PostgreSQL] and [Postico].
